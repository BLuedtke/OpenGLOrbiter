#OpenGLOrbiter

C++ OpenGL Project for visualising satellite orbits around earth based on their orbital elements.

The Project uses GLFW, GLEW, OpenGL and FreeImage, all in 64-bit.
This is a Visual Studio Project (2017 Enterprise). Trying to get the project running with other IDEs is not guaranteed to work.

There is no guaranteed maintenance or support if this does not work on your computer.

Numerical instability may occur if the application is not limited to 60fps. It might work, it might not.
